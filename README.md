# WindTurbineAssignments
Will contain all the code / files for the assignments

Git presents the avantage that everyone can work on the source folder (cloned locally) and then submit it to GitHub. One could also work on someone's code by cloning it to its local directory (I guess). 


What is Git ? 
-- Git is a powerfull version control. 

What is a Version control ? 
-- It a software / tool that enables you to save the different version of a project (generaly speaking)

Still confused ? 
-- See that as a google drive where everyone could work separatly on the code assignment1.m and then have access to someone's modifications. 

Maybe, but how does it work ? 
-- First of, for Git to work, you'll have to use your Terminal. Once you have found how to open a Terminal window, you've done most of the jobs. 

Hang on, what is a Terminal window ? 
-- I guess at the very beginning of computer, it was the only interface to communicate to the computer. 

Ok got it, what's next ?
-- Create an account on GitHub.com, which hosts the master version of the project (for us it's gonna be the data files, the matlab code and do one, but it can be extended to everything !)
